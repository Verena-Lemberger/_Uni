Data Set Information:

This is a classic dataset used in many data mining tutorials and demos -- perfect for exploratory analysis and building binary classification models to predict survival. Data covers passengers only, not crew.

Variables:

- survival: Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
- class: Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
- name: Name
- sex: Sex
- age: Age
- sibsp: Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
- parch: Number of Parents/Children Aboard
- ticket: Ticket Number
- fare: Passenger Fare
- cabin: Cabin
- embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
- boat: Lifeboat (if survived)
- body: Body number (if did not survive and body was recovered)
- home_destination: Home destination of the passenger

Variable Notes: 

pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
