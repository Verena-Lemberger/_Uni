# Moby Dick Web-Scraper and Command Line Game

## What is it?
This is a python web-scraper and command line game. It scrapes the complete moby dick book from "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-h/2701-h.htm" and extracts the most common words from each chapter. You then get questions about the data we extracted.

The types of questions can either be what the most common word in a chapter is, or which word (out of 2 possible choices) occurs more often in a specific chapter.

Your job is to answer at least 3 out of 5 questions correctly to win the game.



## Setup & Installation

To play the game you must have at least Python 3 (we used version 3.7) installed. Additionally you have to do the following steps:

1. install pipenv (e.g. "brew install pipenv")
2. run "python -m nltk.downloader all" to download the necessary nltk packages (this may take a while)
3. run "pipenv install" to install all the other necessary dependencies
4. run python main.py to start the game
